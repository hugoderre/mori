# Mori - A Twitch Streamer with Artificial Intelligence

Mori is a Twitch streamer powered by OpenAI model language API. She uses a Live2D model (template by *omiso0001212*) on VTube Studio to represent her avatar and text-to-speech (TTS) via Voicemaker to communicate with viewers.

This repository also contains other Mori's features like RLBot or MoriSing.

## How does it work?

Mori uses a Node.js script to interact with the OpenAI API and generate real-time responses to Twitch chat messages. The chat messages are parsed by the OpenAI API and the generated response is converted to voice via Voicemaker. Mori then uses the Live2D model on VTube Studio to synchronize his mouth movements with the generated speech.
